## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- [Framer Motion](https://framer.com/motion/) - For animation


### What I learned

This is actually the **First** landing page that I've ever created properly. I'm using *Mobile-First* workflow, developing for mobile first then desktop. It really easier for me to code since *Tailwind CSS* is also *Mobile-First*. I also learn how to use render data into *React* and splitting components on the website.

### Continued development

There's still a lot to do regarding the components, I had to pass some props that actually *not necessary* if only I could use components better. Also I'm thinking about learning another *React Hooks*.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - Basically all you need to start using tailwind.
